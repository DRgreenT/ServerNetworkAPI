# ðŸ’» ServerNetworkAPI (v0.1a)

A minimalistic Web API that scans your local IPv4 network and provides information like IP, OS, and open ports of all reachable devices.

Currently built with **.NET 9.0**.

---

## Features

- Automatic network scan (IPv4 local)
- Logfile
- RESTful Web API (JSON output)
- Device & Port scanning via `nmap`
- OS recognition (basic detection implemented)
- Persistent device data (loaded on startup)
- HTML GUI template

## How It Works

The application continuously scans the local network using ICMP (ping) to detect active devices.  
Once a device responds, it runs a detailed `nmap` scan to gather more info such as:

- Open ports
- Very basic OS fingerprinting
- Hostname

At shutdown, all scan results are saved to disk and restored at the next start.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Linux x64 System
- [.NET 9.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) (only needed if you build it your self)
- [nmap](https://nmap.org/) installed and accessible via command line

## Run
You can download the **latest prebuilt Linux release** here:  
[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/DRgreenT/ServerNetworkAPI/blob/main/publish/linux.zip)

Simply copy the binary to your Linux machine, unpack and execute it:

```bash
chmod +x ServerNetworkAPI
./ServerNetworkAPI
```
To run the program [nmap] is mandator, you can check with ```nmap --version```; in case its not installed than:<br>
```sudo apt install nmap```    # Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS<br>
```sudo pacman -S nmap```      # Arch Linux, Manjaro<br>
```sudo dnf install nmap```    # Fedora<br>
```sudo zypper install nmap``` # openSUSE<br>

To access the API from another device in your local network, make sure port 5050 is open:<br>
```sudo ufw allow 5050```                                                              # Debian/Ubuntu (with UFW enabled)<br>
```sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=5050/tcp --permanent && sudo firewall-cmd --reload```  # Fedora/CentOS<br>
```sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5050 -j ACCEPT```                             # Fallback (legacy systems)<br>

If you want to use the included localSystems.html template for visualizing the API data,
please make sure to adjust the IP address in the following line:

```const response = await fetch("http://192.168.178.10:5050/network");```

Change the IP (192.168.178.10) to match the device where your API is hosted.
This line is located around line 71 in the localSystems.html file.

## Build (Net9.0 SDK required)

```git clone https://github.com/DRgreenT/ServerNetworkAPI.git```<br>
```cd ServerNetworkAPI```<br>
```dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true```<br>
