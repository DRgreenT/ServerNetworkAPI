# 💻 ServerNetworkAPI (v0.1a)

A minimalistic Web API that scans your local IPv4 network and provides information like IP, OS, and open ports of all reachable devices.

Currently built with **.NET 9.0**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Automatic network scan (IPv4 local)
- Logfile
- 📦 RESTful Web API (JSON output)
- 🔍 Device & Port scanning via `nmap`
- 🧠 OS recognition (basic detection implemented)
- 💾 Persistent device data (loaded on startup)

## 📚 How It Works

The application continuously scans the local network using ICMP (ping) to detect active devices.  
Once a device responds, it runs a detailed `nmap` scan to gather more info such as:

- Open TCP ports
- Basic OS fingerprinting
- Hostname

At shutdown, all scan results are saved to disk and restored at the next start.
