# üíª ServerNetworkAPI (v0.1b)

A minimalistic Web API that scans your local IPv4 network and provides information like IP, OS, and open ports of all reachable devices.

Built with **.NET 9.0**

---

## üöÄ Features

- Automatic local network scan using `arp-scan`
- Optional detailed device scan via `nmap`
- Basic OS recognition
- CLI argument support
- RESTful Web API (JSON output)
- HTML frontend template (optional)
- Persistent device data between restarts
- Color-coded terminal output
- Offline detection & live status
- Logfile creation
- Statically assigned IP detection (highlighted)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The app continuously scans your local network (e.g. `192.168.x.x`) via ARP ping to find active devices.  
For each active IP, it performs (optional) detailed scans via `nmap` to retrieve:

- Open ports & services
- OS fingerprint (basic)
- Hostname

Devices are tracked persistently ‚Äì even offline devices remain in the list (marked as offline).  
If the last octet of a device IP exceeds a defined threshold, it's flagged as *non-DHCP* (e.g. static/manual).

---

## üîß Requirements

- sudo or root privileges (for `arp-scan` and `nmap`)
- Linux x64 system
- [.NET 9.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) (only if building yourself)
- [`nmap`](https://nmap.org/) (optional but recommended)
- [`arp-scan`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/arp-scan) ‚Äì must be installed (`sudo apt install arp-scan`)

## üß™ How to Run

Download the [latest Linux build](https://github.com/DRgreenT/ServerNetworkAPI/blob/main/publish/linux.zip), then:

```bash
chmod +x ServerNetworkAPI
./ServerNetworkAPI
```
To run the program [nmap] and [arp-scan]is mandator, you can check with ```nmap --version``` in case its not installed than:<br>
sudo apt install nmap arp-scan     # Debian, Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS<br>
sudo pacman -S nmap arp-scan       # Arch Linux, Manjaro<br>
sudo dnf install nmap arp-scan     # Fedora<br>
sudo zypper install nmap arp-scan  # openSUSE<br>

To access the API from another device in your local network, make sure port (default) 5050 is open:<br>
```sudo ufw allow 5050```                                                              # Debian/Ubuntu (with UFW enabled)<br>
```sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=5050/tcp --permanent && sudo firewall-cmd --reload```  # Fedora/CentOS<br>
```sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5050 -j ACCEPT```                             # Fallback (legacy systems)<br>

If you want to use the included [Downlaod Html template](https://github.com/DRgreenT/ServerNetworkAPI/blob/main/publish/zip/frontEndTemplate.zip) for visualizing the API data,
please make sure to adjust the IP address to match the device where your API is hosted in the following line (line 1) in the `./JS/script.js` file:

```var localHostIP = "192.168.178.10";```


### Available CLI parameters:
       
`--help/-help`           Shows this help message<br>
`--t {int}`              Delay between loops in seconds (default: 5 min: 1 max:3600)<br>
`--p {int}`              Web API port (default: 5050)<br>
`--c {string}`           Controller name (default: 'network')<br>
`--nmap`                 Set nmap scan active (default ping only)<br>
`--fip {string}`         Default fallback IP mask 192.168.178.<br>

## Build (Net9.0 SDK required)

```git clone https://github.com/DRgreenT/ServerNetworkAPI.git```<br>
```cd ServerNetworkAPI```<br>
```dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true```<br>
